        Former shareholder value creator turned desert ground sloth. Reestablishing a relationship with time, place, and people. Reskilling in the Sonoran desert, harvesting rainwater to grow community foodscapes, collecting solar energy to light our way. Sharing the abundance. Building dual power.<side-note>Or whatever the non-hierarchical version of dual power is... multi-power? manifold power?</side-note>
