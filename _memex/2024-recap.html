    The past year was very eventful for me personally. I quit a tech job in 2022 and had planned to take at least a year off. This was the first full year I have been without a job since I started working 25 years ago&mdash; of which 18 were in the tech industry. In that time I had developed a harmful relationship with work and computers. I was long overdue to recover mentally and physically, as well as refocus my time, energy, and interests on things that didn't involve a screen.

    2024 was a year of upending.

    Looking back, here's a roughly chronological list of highlights from 2024:

<!--   <details>
    <summary>Took a permaculture design class specific to the Sonoran desert.</summary>
    <p>
      The wholistic, long term thinking of permaculture is so essential to nurturing our desert environment. And the practices are different from other biomes, given that water is scarce most of the time, and overwhelmingly abundant for short periods (intense summer monsoons and sometimes winter rains). This class helped me better understand how to “plant the rain” (beneficial terraforming for rain capture and use); design for passive heating and cooling (shade is so so important here); and nurture symbiotic, closed-loop, native food-producing plant systems. It was possibly the most unique and special education experiences of my life.
