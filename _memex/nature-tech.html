		When I first started shifting my work life from tech to growing things, I thought I would find a way to combine the two. Honestly, I’m glad I haven’t felt compelled to try. I appreciate the hard line between them and I’m happy to read others on the same path do too.

		Though I believe it'd be a misuse of the word to call a plant technology, it's a fascinating exercise to view it through the same lens as you would something like a computer. Comparing in this way leads me to a real sense of awe&horbar; plants are so much more elegant than our cludgey computers. And in a way that mirrors our own awe-inspiring existence. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As a technology, plants are ancient self-replicating, gene drifting, solar powered, living machines building themselves from abundant materials in the air and ground, utilizing us and other creatures and the elements for dispersal. 
	</p>

		The real comparison is to embedded systems. Plants have onboard sensors and passively rely on environmental conditions and inputs to kick off changes.

	</p> -->
	<p>
		In my mind, computers and plants occupy some similar territory: magically automatic, minuscule in operation, dictated by invisible-to-us coded instructions, and, with care to selection and application, beneficial to my continued existence. I set up the operating conditions for both, kick off its process, monitor performance along the way, and take the output of its work to make my life easier, better, or just plain possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		My personal approach to working with plants is distinctly different from computers though. My relationship to computers is similar to how I use tools; they're lifeless, they serve me<side-note>for now</side-note>, and I don't have reason to consider their experience. With plants, my relationship is more like a collaboration. I am helping a living being to grow and thrive and propagate. In that way I am not a godly creator or even a manager, but an assistant to the plant doing the real physical work. I believe this perspective leads to a deep reverence for the gradual magic of plants&horbar; a feeling I would describe as spiritual. 
	</p>
<!-- 	<p>
		A hubristic mistake I see in our interactions with plants is to treat them, and their/our operating environment, as we do machines. Industrialized farming attempts to force plants to conform to a different operating environment, one that we think we can control. This fails in a number of ways. We can't actually control the environment and we don't fully understand the ways plants operate within it&horbar;though we hubristically believe we do. This results in the exclusion or destruction of crucial components and the inclusion of harmful ones. We use chemicals that harm nutrient-producing soil microbes, beneficial insects, and ourselves. Monocropping reduces ecosystem relations and limits plants in myriad ways, some of which we may never understand. 
	</p>
	<p>
		When we attempt to create a controlled operating environment, we take on a slice of an unknowably large, interconnected system&horbar; and we've taken on so many slices. When we approach it with the same extractive mentality we do machines. Failure may not be immediately apparent, but the depletion of soils, the decline of food nutrients, the loss of insect and animal life all point to failure at a massive scale.
	</p> -->

		There is an interesting corollary to the AI fears, we have created a thing that will possibly be set free and have reasonable fear about releasing it in the world. I see many of the fears around AI being an acknowledgment of the damage we have done with autonomy and self-replication. I look to plants as a positive outcome in this mind space.

		As a teenager eager to jump and make my mark, I saw nature as a fixed system. How would I participate in its development? Real god-like power in computers. Write a thing on your computer that cast a spell on the whole world. The way other, especially older, people around me treated technology as an unknowable magic. Enchanted by the idea of hacking a little thing that could cast a spell on the world. My personal view of nature had been one of bored reverence. Or disinterest due to my lack of agency in its development. Yes, of course nature is amazing, but I can have no part in its advancement. Somehow my curiosity did not extend into non-human-built systems.

		I was lucky enough to participate in the growing of a small field of heirloom corn this summer. My role had me walking the rows on a daily basis, checking and maintaining plants. I became amazed by the frequent presence of differences between plants: height, number/color/shape/size of ears, color shading, early/late pollination, rate of drying once we cut off irrigation. And that's just the variability in the on-type, healthy plants. There are a whole slew of other, fascinating, off-type features, malformations, and diseases that modified the plants in ways that sometimes killed them, but often meant that they simply grew differently or in bad health: insufficient pollination leading to no or small ears, weak roots or overly wet soil leading to lodging (falling over), unexpected combinations of sexual parts, and an edible fungus known as huitlacoche that grows on the kernels and sometimes overtakes the ear.
