		Farming is hard work. That’s the sentiment at least that we’ve been taught. Increasingly I’m convinced that doing anything worthwhile is hard but is worth the effort. Sure, farming is hard. But growing plants is spiritually rewarding— 10x more than any office work could ever be. It connects you to the land. It connects you to the seasons, and our planet. These connections feel deep, like we evolved to have them. And working at a desk blunts the strength, weakening our spirit.

		But there's another enormous part to this. Farming is hard because our understanding of it, as modern industrialized farming, assumes a headwind that comes with working against nature. Battle the bugs, fight disease, pull and spray the weeds, lock out the animals.

		When you shift perspective you also change your direction, then you have a tailwind— nature is at your back.
