	</p>
	<p>
		This quote is part of an economist's<side-note>Thankfully I don't need to argue directly against economics here, as David Graeber has already <a href="https://davidgraeber.org/articles/against-economics/">done it</a> much better than I could.</side-note> capitalist-centered exploration of worker cooperatives. It exemplifies a central assumption I run into: "high-ability" workers are the beneficiaries and the upholders of meritocracy; they know their worth and won't hesitate to leave for a company that will not only pay more but will reinforce their worth by paying their coworkers less. Not a biography-worthy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">Great Man</a> of history, but someone working successfully within the meritocracy: a great worker.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a former great tech worker, I can credibly say redistribution is an all too rare positive. I have excitedly worked places where every employee at the company made the same salary. It wasn't the equitable pay structure we need in the world, but it was refreshingly egalitarian. And I can contrast that with workplaces where there were real differences in pay, formal and informal hierarchies that resulted, and a cursed culture of secrecy and cut-throat competition. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Is it economically irrational to say that I'd rather prioritize happiness, positive impact, and mutual assured survival for my co-workers over personal salary-maxxing? What good does it do to "get mine" if the world and people around me are undervalued, struggling, or crumbling? Even if I'm outperforming coworkers on some productivity metric, it's not happening in a vacuum, it's likely because my coworkers support me.

<!-- 	<p>
		Am I irrational for wanting to work without declaring founder-dictatorial control and extracting value from my colleagues? Instead of building a moat and competing with the business down the street, wouldn't it be rational to build interdependence, share knowledge and resources, and make decisions democratically?

	<blockquote class="large">
		Each worker's (observable) output depends on ability and on effort, neither of which can be observed separately.

	<p>
		As I understand it, this is a reference to the principal-agent problem. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- If effort is indistinguishable from ability, why would we not treat them with equal importance?  -->
		Strangely, our view of a great worker over indexes on ability and undervalues variables in the effort category. So many things can affect motivation: reward, pride in work, and feelings of importance, purpose, respect, and belonging to name a few. The existence of HR-ified versions of these things acknowledge the need for them, but feel laughably uncanny in their inability to go beyond alien-like corporate facsimiles. 
	</p>
<!-- 	<p>
		We're told the corporate workplace is one of benevolent meritocracy filled with selfish actors. The genius bosses overseeing the workers are deserving of their outsized ownership and rewards. The workers are lucky to have a job with their boss, as it grants them permission to live in society. Maybe they'll learn a thing or two, and a few exceptional underlings, the Great Workers, will nose their grindstone up to the boss chair in the future. Whether or not this is true, is it the world we want?
	</p> -->
	<p>
		To these econo-mystics,<side-note>with their own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_Bull#Criticism">sacred bull</a>, charging in bronze</side-note> cooperatives are a foolish attempt to organize ourselves counter to our naturally capitalistic ways. They believe great workers are a result of capitalism. The normalized cruelty of business says motivation can only come from withholding, competition, and greed. It's a pessimistic view of humanity that is counter to our survival as a cooperative species.
	</p>
	<p>
		What if great workers are standouts in spite of capitalism? The workers that manage to survive in the given system, manage the brutality and alienation, and still succeed. I'm willing to bet  we would see more great workers if there was more opportunity for us to find our optimal role, had more needs met, arrived at work with less stress from living precariously, did not have to grapple with the alienation from out labor, and could use out energy for cooperation instead of wasting it on competition. Imagine how much greater we would all be.
