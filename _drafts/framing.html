    <blockquote>
        "What are the consequences of the stories we tell? What do stories do? What do we do with the stories we tell? How do you change your story and how does that change the world?  We often pretend that stories are givens, it's just that way. There are facts: measels are contageous, guns can kill people. But then there are [stories like]: you are my enemy, I'm right about this, there is only one way to do this [...] We've built these houses out of stories&mdash; take up residence in them. And in one way they're invivible to us. We don't say: 'I could be living in a completely different story'. And another way we see them, but see them as inevitable when we don't see ourselves as the storytellers. And so much, I think, of becoming free is becoming the storyteller of our own story; choosing to define who you are, what you're here for, and what your possibilities are."

	<h3>Thought Technology</h3>
	<p>
		In the same way that all the man-made objects around us were dreamed up by someone, then designed, constructed, and transported to us, so were our ideas. Our worldviews are comprised of an overlapping mess of frames, a soup of stories that help us make sense of the world with ingredients we picked up from parents, teachers, politicians, and the billboard that caught you at just the right moment. 
	</p>
	<p>
		While shared frames are the beneficial fabric of our society, they are also sometimes contradictory, or fanciful, or past their expiration, and they're always incomplete because raw reality is full of <a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/47.1/introducing-the-idea-of-hyperobjects">hyperobjects</a>  our dinky brains are underequipped to comprehend.&sext;<span class="sidenote">&sext; If ever there was a sentiment that gets at my non-religious spirituality, it's this.</span> We'll forever be blindfolded guessing at the elephant in front of us.
	</p>

			<figcaption>It's a snake. It's a spear. It's a wall. It's a rhetorical device.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</p>
	<p>
		To add even more wrinkles, society is constantly trying to modify our frames or slyly slip another one on the pile. As Rebecca Solnit describes in the quote above, narrative framing is a neutral tool. It can be a statement of fact or it can be the arena in which an argument is made. Either way, it sets the bounds of the ideas we internalize that then shape how we perceive the world. The lenses we wear everyday that color our sense of what is possible.
	</p>
<!-- 	<p>
		Framing as control. Framing limits thought.

	<p>
		<!-- We are swimming in frames that orient our perspective in line with all kinds of ideologies.  -->
		A frame is also an angle. Situations and activities can be seen from multiple angles. This speaks to the slipperiness and subjectivity of reality, and underlines the importance of understanding how framing works. Especially when it's used as a tool for manipulation. 
	</p>
	<!-- <p>
		An example: I give money to someone that is begging on the sidewalk. Two of the common ways of framing this act paint it positively (charity) or negatively (enabling)*<span class="sidenote">* There are, of course, other ways to view this but I wanted to choose two that people often encounter.</span>. The charity framing comes from a worldview that acknowledges people fall on hard times and encourages helping in ways that we can. The enabling framing says that success comes to those that work hard to get it and giving someone money that is not working for it is hurting their chances at success. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Though I have strong opinions about them both, I won't get into the differences in ideologies here. The point is these are <em>wildly</em> different ways to view an action. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Even before we do the action, we have subconsciously considered the framings that are known to us and chosen an action that fits an ideology. There are of course other ways to frame this situation that could lead to very different actions. To list a few others:
	</p>
	<dl style="margin-left:15px">
		<dt>Judgemental charity</dt>
		<dd>I decide to only give this person food, because I worry they might use money to buy drugs or alcohol.</dd>
		<dt>Non-judgmental inclusion / Mutual aid</dt>
		<dd>I invite the person to the food pantry, church, or other community organization because that's where I have received support</dd>
		<dt>Meritocratic paternalism</dt>
		<dd>I tell them to stop being lazy and get a job</dd>
		<dt>Non-judgmental curiosity</dt>
		<dd>I stop to talk to the person to understand their situation with the idea that maybe I could more meaningfully help if I knew more</dd>
		<dt>Busy; focused on self</dt>
		<dd>I am too busy to do anything so I keep walking</dd>
		<dt>Afraid; focused on self</dt>
		<dd>I am afraid of this person so I uncomfortably keep walking</dd>
	</dl> -->
<!-- 	<ul>
		<li>I decide to only give this person food, because I worry they might use money to buy drugs or alcohol.</li>
		<li>I invite the person to the food pantry, or church, or other community organization because that's where I have received support</li>
		<li>I see this person as lazy and tell them to get a job</li>
		<li>I stop to talk to the person to understand their situation with the idea that maybe I could more meaningfully help if I knew more</li>
		<li>I am too busy to do anything so I keep walking</li>
		<li>I am afraid of this person so I uncomfortably keep walking</li>
	</ul> -->
<!-- 	<p>
		Clearly, not all framing is harmful to you or others, but it's important to be able to recognize when something is framed to manipulate us. Some reasons people choose manipulative framing: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>lead us to a conclusion about an event</li>
		<li>get us to agree with a falsehood or partial truth</li>
		<li>get our consent to allow something to be done to us or on our behalf</li>
		<li>convince us to buy something</li>
		<li>influence our vote in an election</li>
		<li>leading us to choose from an artificially limited set of options</li>
		<li>leading us to obedience, conformity, or inaction</li>
		<li>leading us to adopt a view for their validation</li>
	</ul> -->
	<p>
		Manipulative framing is so pervasive that, without a proper defense, we often aren't aware that it's even happening. A secret, mind-altering spell. And because framing is a rhetorical device that shapes ideas, if it's successfully received, the frame is self-reproducing. By collectively acting and communicating within them, we reshape the world to fit our frames, sometimes at great cost to those that are unjustly on the wrong side of the shades.
	</p>
<!-- 	<p>Examples of statements that have manipulative framing:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"Healthcare should be available to all."</li>
		<li>"This is a transformative technology."</li>
		<li>"This company is a family."</li>
		<li>"Without incentive, no one would work or innovate."</li>
	</ul> -->

<!-- 	<h3>Manipulative Framing</h3>
	<p>	
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How does this person benefit from telling me this?</li>
	</ul> -->

	<h3>Defensive Reframing</h3>
	<p>
		Thankfully we don't have to be passive in the framing process. We have the power to reframe as a defense against this rhetorical device. There are questions we can ask ourselves to get at framing when it may not be apparent. A counter spell, or a spell revealer at least. With practice, we can embed these questions as filters in our information intake process. 
	</p>
	<p>Examples of questions useful in reframing:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How does this person benefit from telling me this?</li>
		<!-- <li>Who owns this?</li> -->
		<li>Does this statement only apply to a limited group?</li>
		<li>Does this statement present the whole situation or just part?</li>
		<li>Why is this information being shown to me?</li>
		<li>Who benefits from me acting a certain way?</li>
		<li>Who stands to gain from the options presented or excluded?</li>
		<li>Who stands to gain from my work?</li>
		<li>Will anything change if I do something different?</li>
		<li>Who is in power in this situation?</li>
		<li>Who is powerless in this situation?</li>
		<li>Why is someone resisting a change?</li>
		<li>Are there key words that may be misleading?</li>
		<li>At what level in a process do I feel empowered to act?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The example statements with the manipulative framing exposed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Healthcare should be available to all.
			<dl>
  				<dd>Q: Are there key words that may be misleading? </dd>
  				<dd>A: "Available" does not imply affordability</dd>
  			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>This is a transformative technology.
			<dl>
  				<dd>Q: Does this statement only apply to a limited group?</dd>
  				<dd>A: The technology will only be transformative to those that can afford it.</dd>
  			</dl>
		</li>
		<li>This company is a family.
			<dl>
  				<dd>Q: Who benefits from me acting in a certain way?</dd>
  				<dd>A: It's assumed that care and generosity come with a family. Employees approaching work with that attitude helps a workplace run smoothly. But in reality that care and generosity are an extremely conditional rarity when coming from the company back to the employees.</dd>
  			</dl>
		</li>
	</ul>

<!-- 
<p>Framing is so important. It not only sets the bounds for an argument but it shapes your sense of what is possible. When someone tries to tell you a thing is impossible (I.e. peace in the Middle East). Before you let that sink in, I like to think about the bounds of possibility in that persons mind. Is it impossible for Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace? Or is it impossible within the bounds of acceptability according to some collection of ideologies? </p>

<p>If you listen only to what people say, </p>

<p>Framing and perspective. I always have to remind myself to examine anything said through those lenses. That’s how you get two groups accusing each other of genocide. </p> -->
