	<h3>Great Worker</h3>
	<p>
        In what feels like a previous life, I was a tech guy. From 2006 to 2022, I worked in just about every part of software development: founder, employee, designer, programmer, product manager. All the hats. And I made soft wares that were used by millions of people and raked in bajillions of dollars for my employers. 
    </p>
  	<p>
  		My path there was pretty typical for the post-bubble internet resurgence period. I took to computers at an early age. Then in college, I became enchanted by Paul Graham's mythologizing about the <a href="https://paulgraham.com/gh.html">Great Hacker<a> and I decided to shape myself into that image. I didn't see a route to this in college, so I eventually spun a little startup idea with friends, got the attention of Y-Combinator, and dropped out to be incubated under the wings of Mr. Graham himself.<side-note>An experience worthy of its own post.</side-note> Though our startup eventually folded without finding success, the years of hustling molded me into a unicorn,<side-note>Before "unicorn" meant billion dollar company, people used it to describe a designer that could code.</side-note> and I had no problem finding employment.
	</p>
<!-- 	<p>
  		We ended up taking more VC money, somewhere around $1.25M total, which allowed us to hire a few folks and really make a run at our idea. But never found the success needed to keep us afloat and we eventually wound things down. At this point, I likely would have started another company, if it were not for the fact that a health event was deemed a preexisting condition and made me uninsurable as an individual. I needed to be on an employer health insurance plan. Thankfully, the years of hustling molded me into a unicorn, and I had no problem finding employment.<side-note>Before "unicorn" meant billion dollar company, people used it to describe a designer that could code.</side-note>
  	</p> -->
  	<p>
  		In startups, my versatility and speed allowed me to pop in wherever I was needed. In bigger companies, I bucked the specialization pressure and used my breadth to bridge departments with hybrid roles&horbar; prototyper, design engineer, operations and developer tools maker&horbar; and eventually product management and leadership.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		I tell you all of this not to brag, rather to say that I believe I mostly reached my goal of becoming a great hacker, and along the way became a worker that economists would describe with the words “high-ability” or “highly productive" in their research papers. Not a biography-worthy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">Great Man</a> of history, but someone working successfully within the meritocracy: a Great Worker.
  	</p>
  	<h3>Great Disappointment</h3>
  	<p>
		I wish I could say I was proud of my accomplishment, but I found no satisfaction in my success as a Great Worker in tech world. I could have worked almost anywhere in tech, contriubted to the coolest projects, and banked major bucks. But I didn't like the options. Either be used as a tool in working toward someone else's vision, with little to no say in the direction of the work, mostly for the benefit of large shareholders. Or found a company, work myself to the bone, and lord over employees. Whether I was an employee or a founder, there were systemic issues I couldn't avoid. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
		As I gained more familiarity with the tech business world, I realized I have fundamental disagreements with the way work is organized and performed: 
  	</p>
<!--   	<p>
  		The freedom and self-directedness of being a co-founder had spoiled me for employment, but I also couldn't bare the power disparity of being an employer.
		It stopped mattering how cool, challenging, or shiny the project was when I knew most companies would always have some mixture of the same drawbacks. And sure, I could start my own company and run it as I liked, but I couldn't bare perpetuating to the same systemic issues from a position of power. As I gained more familiarity with the system, I realized I have fundamental disagreements with the way work is organized and performed:

  		<summary>A foundation of false meritocracy</summary>
  		<p>
  			While startup koolaid tells us our hard work will be rewarded, the reality is that's just another flavor of the American Dream scam. Those with generational wealth and access to power are more likely to rise to the top. Money buys a good education, pays for internships, funds startups, and buys room for mistakes by ensuring a soft landing. Access to someone powerful gets you favors and selective enforcement of rules.

		<summary>Exploiting humans as a dependency</summary>
		<p>
			Business extracts as much as it can from workers while doing everything it can to keep wages low, reduce them, or even avoid paying them altogether.<side-note>Wage theft <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/wage-theft-bigger-problem-forms-theft-workers/">eclipses</a> all other theft crimes in the United States and yet it's almost never discussed seriously in our media.</side-note>
		</p> 
		<p>
			Venture capitalists (VCs), like Paul Graham, prey on the hopes of ambitious people. He benefits from <a href="https://paulgraham.com/when.html">encouraging</a> them toward startups and Y-Combinator, then pushing them to work themselves to the bone because he benefits when they succeed, but loses comparatively little when they don't. Then VCs pressure their entrepreneurs to turn around and exploit their workers in order to get to an exit or profitability.
		</p>
		<p>
			Entire industries are built around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/02/technology/uber-drivers-psychological-tricks.html">bamboozling workers</a> into accepting less money for more labor, or arbitraging labor costs in other countries. Humans are just another resource to exploit&horbar; that is until they automate people out of work.<side-note>But then how will we get money to buy their products and services?</side-note>

	<details>
		<summary>Non-democratic decision making</summary>
		<p>
			Corporate workplaces are often the most influential governing organization in  people's lives and they're undeniably undemocratic. Decisions are made by executives and shadowy boards with plutocratic control.

		<summary>Manipulative culture</summary>
		<p>
			Workplaces employ a heavy doses of internal-facing propaganda to encourage a kind of leader worship that leans on, and reinforces, the meritocratic justification for their power. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I witnessed this in basically every place I worked. CEOs were celebrities with a cultivated mystique. Having worked with a number of them directly, I believe executive positions attract narcisists or transforms people into them. 
		</p>
	</details>
	<p>
		I say all this as someone who has benefited <b style="font-weight: 600;">greatly</b> from the way things work currently. I think it's important to be honest with ourselves about the system we have inherited and continue to perpetuate, because we all suffer from its brutality, precarity, and alienation. 
	</p>
	<p>
		And as one of the reviered Great Workers
	</p>
	<p>
		For me to say "I earned mine", and cast a judgmental eye on those with less, would be acting in ignorance of the way this system works. For me to take the road to venture capital, as so many of my contemporaries did, would be me putting a hand on the controls of this awful machine. And for me to make a stink about my issues, while not standing in solidarity with the other people on whom my work depends, would be selfish.
	</p>
<!-- 	<p>
		<s>The competition and self-righteousness were downright harmful. At companies small and large, my co-workers worshiped C-suiters while stomping on each other, and me, trying to get a taste of power, fame, and the large differences in pay.<side-note>While equity packages helped with this some, they also had stratifying effect, creating social hierarchies for people doing the same work </side-note> When I was in the owner/founder position, this tendency made me extremely uncomfortable.</s>
	</p> -->
<!-- 	<p>
		The horrors of the working world will forever leave their mark on me, emotionally and phyically. 
	</p> -->
<!-- 	<p>
		I can go on.. the difference of value between positions created unjust social hierarchies. CEO worship was rampant. Great workers were catered to and coddled and excused of terrible behavior. 
	</p> -->
	<p>
		Finally, after years of working long hours, repetitive stress injuries, being disconnected from friends and family, multiple major burnout and recovery cycles, and feeling ashamed of the affect my work was having on the world, I quit.
	</p>
<!-- 
  	<p>
  		As a Great Worker, I realized a few things.  I didn’t feel the self-importance that Paul Graham felt and so many others in tech world still feel. Glorifying greatness glorifying a fussy, antisocial way of working with others. The greatness of a great hacker isn't necessarily transitive.
<br>
  		I didn't think I was better than anyone. The power of a reputation. I could use this status to my advantage. 
<br>
  		I could work almost anywhere in tech&horbar; in a software-consumed world, that meant almost any industry. I could seek out the coolest projects and get paid major bucks.
  	</p> -->
	<h3>Don't Stifle the Great Worker</h3>
<!-- 	<p>
They are the dedicated model worker on which a Great Man relies. They are distinct from founders/owners in that they don't call the shots,<side-note>Though they could be if they wanted.</side-note> but they are the cream that should be allowed to rise to the top of an org chart and/or pay ladder.

		In trying to answer the question, "where are all the worker cooperatives?", I sometimes find myself with a printed out economics <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w6118/w6118.pdf">research paper</a>, scribbling notes in the margins. In those pages, I keep running into a persona: the highly productive worker (HPW).
	</p> -->
	<p>
		As a Great Worker, I take issue when I encounter sentences like the following in an economics paper:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		"...high-ability cooperative members can credibly threaten to leave the firm if there is too much redistribution."
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		<small><a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w6118/w6118.pdf">Why Are Worker Cooperatives So Rare?</a> - Michael Kremer 1997</small>
	</p>
	<p>
		For context, the paper is attempting to make an argument against worker cooperatives, and this sentence is central. The assumption is that Great Workers are selfish actors and upholders of meritocracy; they know their worth and won't hesitate to leave for a company that will not only pay more but will uphold their status through pay disparity.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a distinct flavor of exceptionalism here: some people are just better than others and they should be rewarded for that. Strong disagree.
	</p>
	<h3>Exceptionalist Justice</h3>
	<p>
		Another quote from the same paper is very telling.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		Each worker's (observable) output depends on ability and on effort, neither of which can be observed separately.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		If effort is indistinguishable from ability, we must treat them with equal importance. But our view of the Great Worker overindexes on ability and does not consider all the variables in the effort category. So many things can affect motivation: reward, sense of importance and purpose, and pride in work to name a few.
	</p>
	<p>
		We're told the corporate workplace is one of benevolent meritocracy filled with selfish actors. The genius bosses overseeing the workers are deserving of their outsized ownership and rewards. The workers are lucky to have a job with their boss, as it grants them permission to live in society. Maybe they'll learn a thing or two, and a few exceptional underlings, the Great Workers, will nose their grindstone up to the boss chair in the future. Whether or not this is true, is it the world we want?
	</p>
	<p>
		It is a mistake to think of the Great Worker as a consequence of capitalism. What if Great Workers are standouts in spite of capitalism? The workers that manage to thrive in the given system, overcome the brutality and alienation, and still succeed. I'm willing to bet if there was more opportunity for workers to find their optimal role, had more needs met, arrived at work with less stress from living precariously, and did not have to grapple with the alienation from their labor, we would see more Great Workers.

	<h3>The World of Work I want</h3>
	<p>
		Instead of 
	</p>
	<p>
		As a high-productivity individual, is it irrational to say that I'd rather prioritize happiness, positive impact, and mutual assured survival for my community over salary-maxxing? What good does it do to "get mine" if the world and people around me are crumbling?
	</p>
	<p>
		Am I irrational for wanting to work without declaring founder-dictatorial control and extracting value from my colleagues? Instead of building a moat and competing with the business down the street, wouldn't it be rational to build interdependence, share knowledge and resources, and make decisions democratically?
