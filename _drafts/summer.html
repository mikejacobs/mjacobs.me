		It's now October 1st and the desert southwest US is in the midst of a late season resurgence heatwave. Daytime temperatures have been around 105&deg; F for two weeks. It wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the two weeks before were distinctly fall weather: highs in the 80-90s and lows in the 60s. <side-note>That may still sound hot, but I've found the lack of humidity makes it feel the equivalent to a NE temperature that's 10-15&deg;F cooler.</side-note>

		Talking with a friend in NYC, I remembered summers here have similarities with winter in the northeast&horbar; long, difficult seasons for the respective places. I experienced two winters in NYC. Itâ€™s enjoyable at first but outlasts its welcome and everyone wants it to be over by the end. And there is often a last kick in the face of a dreaded late season snow storm in NE&horbar; just like our heatwave now. Summer here usually begins a bit after the spring equinox and ends a bit after the fall equinox&horbar; April to October.

		Having grown up here in the desert, my heat tolerance is higher than most. I delight in acclimating to doing work outdoors when it's 100+&deg; F. There are all kinds of climate-specific techniques for hydration and cooling. As well as clothing that can protect me from sun, heat, and hostile desert plants and insects. Shorts and a tanktop will do for short periods, but you will begin to cook rather quickly.

		A key difference between these long seasons is that for a big chunk of summer in the desert, the nighttime temperatures are bearable. So people often shift their schedules to take advantage. I'm writing this right now on the porch at 5:30AM before work.

		Inevitably I grow tired of it and join everyone in running indoors around 9AM, when work allows, as the thermometer pushes past 95&deg; F. I have heard that less heat tolerant people get seasonal affective disorder for the same reasons at folks in the north&horbar; spending all their time inside away from the sunlight. At this point in the season, I think I'd rather have a long winter, but that may just be my heat-addled brain doing some grass-is-greenering.
